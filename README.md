# Customer Segmentation Project:

This repository contains code and documentation for an unsupervised machine-learning project focused on customer segmentation. 
The project explores various clustering algorithms to group customers based on their behavior, preferences, and financial habits.

# Goals:

  ## üìùBusiness Goals:
  Extract meaningful patterns and insights from your customer data without relying on predefined labels or categories.
  By employing unsupervised learning techniques, you aim to group customers based on similarities in their behavior, preferences, or characteristics.
  This segmentation can then be utilized for various business purposes such as targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, product development, or optimizing service delivery.

  ## üìùLearning Goals:
  Explore several methods for customer segmentation, including:

*  **T-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding):** A technique for visualizing high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional space while preserving local structure.

*  **K-means clustering:** A popular algorithm for partitioning data into clusters based on similarity, where each cluster is represented by its centroid.

*  **Hierarchical clustering:** A method that builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging or splitting them based on a distance metric.

*  **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** An algorithm that groups closely packed points and identifies outliers as noise.

*   **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** A probabilistic model representing a mixture of Gaussian distributions, often used for clustering data.

*   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A technique for dimensionality reduction, which can help in visualizing and understanding the structure of high-dimensional data.

*   **Kernel PCA:** An extension of PCA using kernel methods to handle nonlinear relationships in data.
 
*  **GAP statistic method:** A technique for selecting the optimal number of clusters by comparing within-cluster dispersion to that expected under a null reference distribution.</p>
